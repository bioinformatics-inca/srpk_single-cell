# SRPK at single-cell resolution 🧬🔍

This repository contains code used to generate the figures associated with the study "The SRPKs inhibitor N-(2-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl) isonicotinamide (SRPIN340) increases the immune response against metastatic melanoma in mice". The data belong to the work of Jerby-Arnon et al (2018), and our aim was to analyze the role of SRPKs among the subcluster of malignant cells.
